The support folder contains files that are automatically included by Cypress before every test run.
This is a great place to put reusable behavior such as custom commands or global overrides.
For example, you might define custom commands in commands.js for actions that are used frequently
across many tests. The support folder helps you avoid repeating the same code in multiple test
files, promoting DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.
