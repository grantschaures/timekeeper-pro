This directory is used to store static data that can be used in your tests.
Fixtures are often used to represent the data that your application might expect
to receive from external sources. For example, you might have JSON files representing
mocked API responses. This allows you to write tests that are not dependent on external
systems and can be run reliably in any environment.
